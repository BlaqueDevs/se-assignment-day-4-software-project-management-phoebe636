Market Competitiveness – Late product releases can result in lost market opportunities.
Resource Management – Prolonged projects may disrupt resource allocation and planning for future tasks.
Compliance & Contractual Obligations – Many projects have legal and financial penalties for late delivery.
How to Ensure Deadlines Are Met:
Clear Project Scope & Requirements: Define deliverables, objectives, and milestones at the outset.
Effective Scheduling: Use tools like Gantt charts or Kanban boards to plan timelines.
Agile Methodologies: Break down work into sprints to ensure regular progress.
Risk Management: Identify potential bottlenecks early and create contingency plans.
Regular Progress Reviews: Conduct weekly or bi-weekly meetings to track progress.
Resource Optimization: Ensure the right team members are assigned to the right tasks.
Use of Project Management Software: Tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana help in tracking tasks and deadlines.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Importance of Cost Control:
Effective cost control ensures that a software project remains financially viable and delivers maximum value. It helps in:
Preventing Financial Losses – Poor cost control can lead to losses, making the project unfeasible.
Ensuring Profitability – Keeping costs within budget ensures profit margins are maintained.
Avoiding Scope Creep – Uncontrolled expansion leads to unnecessary expenditures.
Optimal Resource Utilization – Efficient budgeting ensures resources are used effectively.
Maintaining Stakeholder Confidence – Investors and clients trust projects that stay within budget.
Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:
Accurate Initial Budget Estimation – Use historical data and expert input for realistic cost projections.
Scope Management – Clearly define scope and avoid unnecessary feature additions.
Regular Budget Monitoring – Track expenditures in real time to detect deviations early.
Risk Contingency Planning – Allocate a buffer budget for unforeseen expenses.
Use of Cost Management Software – Tools like Microsoft Project or SAP ERP assist in cost tracking.
Frequent Financial Reporting – Weekly or monthly reports help in keeping costs in check.
Optimizing Workforce Efficiency – Avoid overstaffing or underutilization of developers.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile Methodology:

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validates product meets user expectations.
Importance of Maintaining High Standards:
Reliability: Prevents crashes and downtime.
User Satisfaction: Ensures a smooth and efficient user experience.
Security: Reduces vulnerabilities to cyber threats.
Reputation: Builds trust and credibility in the market.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Importance of Defining Project Scope:
Prevents scope creep, ensuring the project remains manageable.
Aligns stakeholder expectations from the beginning.
Helps in resource and time allocation.
What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?
A hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
Why is WBS Useful?
Improves task delegation and team accountability.
Helps in estimating timelines and costs more accurately.
Enhances project tracking through milestones.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:
Improves time management.
Ensures efficient resource allocation.

Provides a clear roadmap for stakeholders.
How Gantt Charts Help:
Visualize project timelines and dependencies.
Track task progress in real-time.
Identify delays and required adjustments.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

Identifying Core Issues:
A software product must solve a real problem or significantly improve an existing process. Core issues can be categorized as follows:
Inefficiency – Manual processes that take too long and need automation.
High Costs – Reducing operational expenses through software-driven solutions.
Lack of Accessibility – Making services more available (e.g., mobile banking for remote users).
Security Risks – Addressing cybersecurity threats in business or personal use cases.
Poor User Experience – Simplifying complex processes for better adoption.
Why These Problems Are Significant to the Target Audience:
Impact on Business Efficiency: Software that optimizes workflow increases productivity.
